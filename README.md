## Additional Notes
This project was made as practice to learn about manipulating JSON in Javascript. As a Millennial with Gen Z humor and zero creativity, I found Big Joes' videos on TikTok hilarious and thought it would make for a good learning opportunity. This is open source under the GNU GPL v3 license meaning you can use this code freely, as long as, it's not for proprietary use.
